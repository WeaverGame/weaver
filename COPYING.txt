XreaL Media License
_______________________

The media is not tied to a single license unlike in other free game projects.
Every file can have its own copyright and license that reflects the idea of "The Open Source Definition".
See http://opensource.org/docs/osd for further information.

As game media is not source code we prefer the "Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported" license.
See http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/ for more details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See XreaL/base/MEDIA.txt for a listing of the individual copyrights and licenses of media files.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To keep track of all copyrights and licenses, we use Subversion properties for each file.
If you are not familiar with Subversion properties then have a look at the
SVN Manual Chapter 7. Advanced topics - Properties.

These properties are:

svn:copyright = lists all authors who were involved
svn:license = contains what license is this asset set under
svn:source = optional information where this file was grabbed from

Properties can be listed via the svn proplist command:

$ svn proplist -R -v base/sound/
Properties on 'base/sound/misc/menu1.wav':
  svn:source : http://freesound.iua.upf.edu/samplesViewSingle.php?id=24782
  svn:license : Creative Commons Sampling Plus 1.0
  svn:mime-type : application/octet-stream
  svn:copyright : (c) 2006 young_daddy

JPEG library

code/jpeg-6
Copyright (C) 1991-1995, Thomas G. Lane

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

NOTE: unfortunately the README that came with our copy of the library has
been lost, so the one from release 6b is included instead. There are a few
'glue type' modifications to the library to make it easier to use from
the engine, but otherwise the dependency can be easily cleaned up to a
better release of the library.
